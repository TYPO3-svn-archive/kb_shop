How to extend KB-Shop.




1. Adding new property types
============================


To add a new property type like "String/Database Relation/Files/etc." you have
to add the new property in various places.


1.1 tca_property.php
--------------------

This is the TCA defintion file for a property. You have to add your new type
to the 'type' field definition in order for the new type to show up in the
type field. You'll have to assign the property a number here which will follow
the property through the whole system.

  1.1.1 'type' field
--------------------

Add the new field to the list of items and assign it a not-used-number. Also
add the new label to the locallang_db.php file.

  1.1.2 'flexform' field
------------------------

Add the new field to the list of ds-configuration files and define a file-name
for the DS XML file which will contain the DS configuration of the property.


1.2 DS XML file
---------------

Copy one of the existing DS XML files in the res folder to the name of the new
properties DS XML file (which you assigned in the previous step) and modifiy
it to your needs. This DS will get shown when editing a property of the new
type in the Flexform of the property.
When changing the locallang labels don't forget to also add them in the
locallang_db.php file.

1.3 Property TCA Language Modes: class.tx_kbshop_itemproc.php
-------------------------------------------------------------

In this file there is one "TYPEADD" comment (line 69). Here you have to add
you property if it requires to remove the "prefixLangTitle" language Mode from
the select box - or others.


1.4 TCA-Generation: class.tx_kbshop_tcagen.php
----------------------------------------------

In this file the type must get added at some places. These lines are marked
with a "TYPEADD" comment.

  1.4.1 $renderFunc class variable (line 44)
--------------------------------------------

This is a class variable which holds the name of the responsible TCA rendering
function for an specific property type.

  1.4.2 TCA render method invocation (line 108)
-----------------------------------------------

Here the render method get's invocated. Check that the $t variable (the number
of the type as specified in tca_property.php) is in the checked bounds and
increase the upper bound dependend on how many property types you add.

  1.4.3 TCA render method definition (line 452)
-----------------------------------------------

Add methods with the names of the values you added to the $renderFunc array in
step 1.3.1 to the class. See methods above line 452 for an example.



1.5 SQL-Generation: class.tx_kbshop_sqlengine.php
-------------------------------------------------

In this file there is one place where you have to add the new property. In
line 339 there starts a switch statement:
        switch ($fArr['type'])  {
At the bottom of this switch statement there is again a "TYPEADD" comment. Add
your new property type here and define the sql which should get created for
it.


1.6 PI Plugin DS XML Generation: class.tx_kbshop_tcagen_pi1.php
---------------------------------------------------------------

There is also one place here marked with a "TYPEADD" comment (line 234) at
which methods for rendering the FE Plugin DS XML form which get's used to
configure the plugin in the BE.

These methods define which fields of the responsible DS file in the res/
directory are visible (when creating criterias) for fields with the specific
type.

See the example above the mentioned line to get an idea what these methods
should do.

If you decide to set the displayCond property of some new fields you will have
to add those fields to the file res/flexform_ds_pi1.xml (or
res/flexform_ds_pi2.xml for the searchable version of the plugin).


1.7 DS XML for FE plugin
------------------------

Like mentioned in the above step you have to edit the files
res/flexform_ds_pi1.php and res/flexform/ds_pi2.ph and add new fields to it if
you set display conditions for fields with a new name in the above step. It
would also be possible to reuse already existing fields and just add a
condition to show it also for the newly introduced property type.


1.8 pi1 FE plugin class: pi1/class.tx_kbshop_pi1.php
----------------------------------------------------

For order to work properly in the FE the new property has to get added at some
places in the FE plugin.


  1.8.1 method "getFieldRenderValue" (line 1237)
------------------------------------------------

Here the value shall get returned which get's outputted into the marker of the
field when no special TS stdWrap configuration has been configured for the
field.

  1.8.2 method "getCriteriaOption" (line 2029)
----------------------------------------------

Here you have to add code which returns the key and label for a value in the
criteria selectors.

  1.8.3 method "setDefinedCriteria (line 2491)
----------------------------------------------

Here you have to add code which defines how the property type get's compared
to the values selected in the criteria selector.
